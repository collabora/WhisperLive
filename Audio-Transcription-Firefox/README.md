# Audio Transcription Firefox

Audio Transcription is a Firefox extension that allows users to capture any audio playing on the current tab and transcribe it using OpenAI-whisper in real time. Users will have the option to do voice activity detection as well to not send audio to server when there is no speech.

We use OpenAI-whisper model to process the audio continuously and send the transcription back to the client. We apply a few optimizations on top of OpenAI's implementation to improve performance and run it faster in a real-time manner. To this end, we used [faster-whisper](https://github.com/guillaumekln/faster-whisper) which is 4x faster than OpenAI's implementation.

## Loading the Extension
- Open the Mozilla Firefox browser.
- Type ```about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox``` in the address bar and press Enter.
- Clone this repository
- Click the Load temporary Add-on.
- Browse to the location where you cloned the repository files and select the ```Audio Transcription Fox``` folder.
- The extension should now be loaded and visible on the extensions page.


## Real time transcription with OpenAI-whisper
This Firefox extension allows you to send audio from your browser to a server for transcribing the audio in real time. 

## Implementation Details

### Capturing Audio
To capture the audio in the current tab, we used the chrome `tabCapture` API to obtain a `MediaStream` object of the current tab.

### Options
When using the Audio Transcription extension, you have the following options:
 - **Use Collabora Server**: We provide a demo server which runs the whisper small model.
 - **Use Multilingual Model**: Enable this option to utilize the multilingual capabilities of OpenAI-whisper.
 - **Language**: Select the target language for transcription or translation. You can choose from a variety of languages supported by OpenAI-whisper.
 - **Task:** Choose the specific task to perform on the audio. You can select either "transcribe" for transcription or "translate" to translate the audio to English.

### Getting Started
- Make sure the transcription server is running properly. To know more about how to start the server, see the [documentation here](https://github.com/collabora/whisper-live).
- Just click on the Firefox Extension which should show 2 options
  - **Start Capture** : Starts capturing the audio in the current tab and sends the captured audio to the server for transcription. This also creates an element to show the transcriptions recieved from the server on the current tab.
  - **Stop Capture** - Stops capturing the audio.


## Limitations
This extension requires an internet connection to stream audio and receive transcriptions. The accuracy of the transcriptions may vary depending on the audio quality and the performance of the server-side transcription service. The extension may consume additional system resources while running, especially when streaming audio.

## Note
The extension relies on a properly running transcription server with multilingual support. Please follow the server documentation for setup and configuration.
